Assembly
Problem 1 - Simple Cipher
The task involves implementing a simple cipher in assembly language for encrypting messages by shifting characters in the English alphabet. The function simple takes a string, a step value, and encrypts the text, considering only uppercase English letters.

Problem 2 - Processes
This problem focuses on working with structures in assembly. The task is to implement functions to sort an array of processes based on priority, time, and ID. Another function calculates the average run time for each priority level.

Problem 3 - Enigma Machine
Inspired by the Enigma machine used in World War II, this task involves simulating the encryption process. Functions need to be implemented to rotate the positions of the Enigma rotors and to encode messages using a given configuration.

Problem 4 - Checkers
In this task, the goal is to simulate the movement of a checker (or dame) on an 8x8 game board. Given the current position, the checkers function calculates and updates the possible positions the checker can move to on the board, considering the game's rules.
